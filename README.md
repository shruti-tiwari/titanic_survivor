# Titanic Survivor Data Analysis

## Project Description

On 15th April 1912, Titanic a British passenger liner was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York city. After a collision with an iceberg, it sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is considered the deadliest peacetime disaster in modern history as out of 2224 passengers and crew members more than 1500 survived[1]. Analysis in this project is based on titanic_survivor.csv data which contains information about 891 on-board passengers. The questions asked in this study are what factors effected the survival of passengers titanic_survivor data.

In current study we address following questions:

1. Which gender and passenger class had better chances of survival?
2. Which age group had best chances of survival?
4. Passengers from which port of embarkation survived most and least?
5. What is the Effect of on-board relatives on survival of passengers?

## Conclusion

The current study and the conclusions below are based on this sample data and can be very different from the full titanic_survivor data.

1. The women and kids percentage of survival are way more than men.
2. The survival percentage of 1st class passengers is the highest and that of 2nd class is the lowest which is due to very low survival percentage of men in 2nd class.
3. Survival percentage of men in second class is the lowest. One of the reasons may be that they offered their seats to women and kids of third class.
4. Most embarkations from Queenstown was in 3rd class hence the survival percentage for Queenstown is the lowest among the three port of embarkations.
5. Most embarkations from Cherbourg were in 1st and 2nd class that's why the survival percentage from Cherbourg is the highest.
6. Most of the children who died were under 5 years of age.
7. Survival percentage for children traveling with family is higher than the ones who were traveling without the family, however, impact of parent on-board is positive while impact of siblings is negative. Survival percentage of women traveling with relative is lower than the women who were traveling without the family while that of men is better with relatives on-board. 
In other words, having relative on-board lowers the chances of survival in adult with higher preference and increases the same in adult with lower preference.
